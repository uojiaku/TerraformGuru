# Cloud Adoption Framework

## Typical Cloud Adoption Phases
- Project -> in the project phase, you are running projects to get familiar and experience benefits from the cloud.

- Foundation -> after experiencing the benefits of cloud, you then build the foundation to scale your cloud adoption. this includes creating a landing zone (a pre-configured, secure, multi-account AWS environment), Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE), operations model, as well as assuring security and compliance readiness.

- Migration -> in this stage, you migrate existing applications including mission-critical applications or entire data centers to the cloud as you scale your adoption across a growing portion of your IT portfolio

- Reinvention -> now that your operations are in the cloud, you can focus on reinvention by taking advantage of the flexibility and capabilities of AWS to transform your business by speeding time to market and increasing the attention on innovation.

- There's more to cloud adoption than tech; to fully unlock the potential benefits of a cloud migration, a holistic approach must be considered.
