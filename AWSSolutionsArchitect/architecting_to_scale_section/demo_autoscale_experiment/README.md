## Auto-Scaling Experiment
| Sequence | Task | Hint |
|:--------:|:----:|:----:|
| 1 | Design an experiment to demonstrate autoscaling to the scientists using cost-effective methods. | X marks the spot |
| 2 | Build the scenario that simulates heavy computational load to trigger scale-out | Sometimes, stress is good |
| 3 | Demonstrate scale-in as the load diminishes | very interesting dynamic |
