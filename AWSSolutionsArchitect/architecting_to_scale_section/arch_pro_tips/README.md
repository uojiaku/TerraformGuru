- think cloud-first designs if we're in a Green Field scenario even if we're deploying on-prem
- if we're in a brown field situation, create roadmaps for cloud-first enablers like distributed applications, federated data and SOA
- be careful to not let elasticity cover for poor development methods
- microservice concepts help achieve scalability via decoupling, simplification and separation of concerns. leveraging business process API concepts.
