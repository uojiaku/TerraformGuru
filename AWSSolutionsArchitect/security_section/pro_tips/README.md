# Pro Tips

- know that security will be front-of-mind for every client evaluating the cloud .. but rarely are there sound processes in place
- acknowledge concerns and be ready with a process (Cloud Adoption Framework is a good start, because it has a specific area around security). If it is made clear that security is a prominent component than the trust level increases with that client
- leverage assessments and checklists as illustrators of care and best-practice. they baseline security practices and then we can compare and contrast what those might look like in future practices when assets are deployed in the cloud. This is a non-confrontational way to evaluate the current state of security practices and maybe objectively point out where there are some gaps that can be improved if organizations move to the cloud.
- migrating to the cloud is often more secure than on-prem due to increased transparency and visibility
- speak in terms of risk as a continuum(level of risk) rather than an absolute (yes or no) 
- consider AWS certified security - specialty or other security-minded certification like CISSP
